title: "Cycling in Helsinki: What has changed?"
---
This project examines how cycling is in Helsinki by comparing several datasets from years 2015 and 2022. We are looking into (1) accident numbers and locations, (2) cyclist counts on specific locations, (3) reachability of public tranport amd (4) citizens' thoughts on Helsinki as a city for cycling.
