In the graph above, we observe the proportion of all crimes committed that were drug/narcotic offenses. California Prop 47 passed in 2014, as annotated in the graph, leading to less police enforcement on drug and narcotics offenses[1]. While there is a larger trend before 2014 of less drug/narcotic incidents reported, one can reasonably assume this very important change in the law at least contributed to the continuation of this trend. In 2017, Fentanyl arrived in San Francisco and started to proliferate through the community, resulting in the spike from 2017 to 2018. The other large spike occurred when the new district attorney entered office in 2022. At this point, fentanyl was ravaging communities in San Fransisco and became a larger voter issue. As such the new District Attorney wanted to crack down on fentanyl, which raised police's likelihood of recording incidents which involved people who did or had consumed fentanyl, or were in possession of fentanyl. This crisis has gotten so bad that the Mayor has declared a state of emergency due to the drug's impact just last month [3]. This will have ramifications for the amount of money that different departments within the police department get, as well as the general culture of San Francisco police in terms of which offenses they prioritize, which is why analyses such as these are important.
